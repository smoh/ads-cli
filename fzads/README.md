# fzads

An experiment to use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/) as a simple ADS browser.

FZF provides a generic UI for browsing one-line lists with preview and actions on list items, mainly through `--preview` and `--bind` options. Combined with shell/python scripts and toos like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/), this is enough to make a terminal ADS browser.
